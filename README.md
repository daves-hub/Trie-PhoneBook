# Trie-PhoneBook
A minimalistic Phonebook web app with trie data structure for searching through contacts.

## Basic features
- Search contact by *prefix*.
- View contact card.
- Create new contact.
- Permanently store contacts on remote server if user is online, so pretty reliable.

## Disclaimer
- Putting in your personal details is at your own risk, its just a fun project, don't over do it.
<!-- Temporary storage Implemented with local storage, so it's not so reliable.-->
<!-- Edit: Details are now stored on a remote server for persistence when you're online. -->

## Backend
 - Code for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/Osalotioman/trie_repo_backend/).
 - The backend was developed using PHP and MySQL for the database.

## Note
There is no calling and stuff. You can consider it a template kind of thing.
